# Supabase setup for Ticket T01

The Flutter client only receives `SUPABASE_URL` and the publishable/anon key.
Never put a `service_role` or `sb_secret_` key in `.env` passed to Flutter.

Apply the migration with the Supabase CLI or the SQL editor. Bootstrap the
first administrator through a trusted service-role operation after creating
the user in the Supabase Auth dashboard:

```sql
insert into public.app_admins (user_id)
values ('AUTH_USER_UUID');
```

An authenticated administrator can then call the two protected RPCs:

```sql
select public.admin_grant_registration_eligibility('person@example.com', 'email');
select public.admin_grant_registration_eligibility('+8613800138000', 'phone');
select public.admin_revoke_registration_eligibility('person@example.com', 'email');
```

The `auth.users` trigger consumes an unused, unrevoked eligibility in the
same database transaction as registration. A race or duplicate registration
therefore cannot consume one qualification twice. The trigger bypasses only
trusted `service_role` creation, which is used for administrator bootstrap.
